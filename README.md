# My fifth project 

## This is the first project of my bootcamp which is a hangman game
In this project, I was tasked to create a simple game using React. The task was to create a React app that allows users to play Hangman. The game picks a random word, which the user must then attempt to guess letter by letter. Too many incorrect guesses result in a loss of the game. Iconically the process of losing is depicted by your character being hanged

## Game Criteria
+ It should be created using Create React App.
+ It should include attractively styled-components
+ A number of components should be rendered using the array.Map() method.
+ User interaction should modify the state of some components.
+ The state of two or more components should be synced.
+ The user should be able to restart the game.
+ The user should be clearly informed if they have “won” or “lost” the game.

Rules of The Game

- type a letter until you can guess the word
- you can not type in the same letter more than once
- if you type 6 wrong letters you lose the game and the person gets hanged
- if you get the word before the person gets hanged you win

Installation instructions

- Download all files from GitHub
- in the project directory run npm init to install the node modules folder
- in the same project directory run npm start to run the app
- Open http://localhost:3000 in the browser to view and play the game
